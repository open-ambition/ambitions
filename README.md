# ambitions
http://www.github.com/open-ambition/ambitions

  This repo shall contain original ideas awaiting the ambition of an inspired developer to share ownership to germinate a new project useful to the open source community, and hopefully beneficial to the rest of the world.

  Ideas will only be proposed after reasonably thorough searching of several code-repositories to avoid reinventing the wheel and duplication of effort.
(ethically it is better to try to contribute improvements to a popular package, as your labor will have more immediate reach) 

My extensive research of prolific central repositories of newly developed or ported software includes the commercial app stores where quality is very haphazard, price is seldom indicative of support, and some keywords have 50 pay products all inferior to the multiple re-brandings of a well-known open-source project, implementations varying in degree of obfuscation of true functionality, mis-representing the licence, and adware.  That all aside, thanks to John Conway's strong law of large numbers, the sheer volume of software hosted contains some truly wonderful gems of apps for occassionally original ideas.  

Unfortunately, I have seen several app-developers enticed by profit to change the license of their previously wonderful app, then replace it with a crippled version requiring purchase to unlock it.

Anyways before claiming "This is Original", search all of these and list all relevant project links and briefly state why they are insufficient for the need you propose (restrictive licensing is often the case):
GitHub.org
Mercurial / SubVersion
SourceForge.net
Code.Google.com (until Jan 2016 when it dies!)
Linux Package Repositories
FreeBSD Ports Collection
Google Play Apps Store (Android)
Google Chrome Apps (WebApps & Extensions)
AppSpot.com (Google Drive Apps)
Apple Itunes App Store
Microsoft Windows 8 Store
Mozilla FireFox Extensions
Mozilla FireFox OS Apps

  I invite everybody who likes this no-pressure recruiting concept to become an Open-Ambition Organization Member, to help work with me providing tools, rationale, and best-practices doctrine to facilitate the widest possible adoption of the ideals of Open Projects through minimizing barriers to contribution, and creating as many opportunities to utilize micro-labor to contribute content extending potential userbase far beyond the original developer's use-case.

Ambitions worthy of listing on the open-ambitions project:
* a key missing feature of a popular project requiring a fork to properly implement the neccessary improvements, provided that you will provide a self-sufficient one-click patch to benefit existing users until the original project maintainers incorporate your improvement.
  
* interesting proof of concept /  useful / time-saving
  
* Ports of an exemplary project to a new platform
* to overcome the inertia of a back-burner or retired project with the easy burst of momentum
